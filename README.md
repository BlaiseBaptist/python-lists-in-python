# Linked Lists
## Description
Code that defines a custom list class (linked lists) and implements and time sorting algorithms on it
## Data Structure
List of nodes

### Nodes
Nodes have a number in them and point to another node

## Sorting Algorithms

||Bubble|Selection|Insertion|Merge|Quick
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
|Time Complexity|O(n<sup>2</sup>)|O(n<sup>2</sup>)|O(n<sup>2</sup>)|O(n log n)|O(n log n)


### Bubble
Compares pairs of elements and swaps them if they are out of order
### Selection
Takes the smallest element of the main list and adds it to a sub-list until 
### Insertion
Takes one element and puts it in its spot
### Merge
Splits the list into elements then merges pairs of sub-lists keeping the elements in order until is one list again
### Quick
Selects a pivot and moves all smaller elements to one side it then does the same to each side of the list
